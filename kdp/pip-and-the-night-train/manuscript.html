    <p>Pip was a small mouse who lived in a tiny house by the railroad tracks.</p>
    <p>Every night, when the stars came out, Pip heard the train go by.</p>
    <p>WHOOOOSH! CLICKETY-CLACK!</p>
</div>

<div class="page">
    <p>"Where does it go?" Pip wondered.</p>
    <p>One night, Pip decided to find out.</p>
</div>

<div class="page">
    <p>He packed a small bag with cheese and crackers.</p>
    <p>He put on his red scarf.</p>
    <p>He waited by the tracks.</p>
</div>

<div class="page">
    <p>WHOOOOSH! Here came the train!</p>
    <p>Pip jumped on.</p>
</div>

<div class="page">
    <p>The train car was full of soft, cozy seats.</p>
    <p>A friendly owl was the conductor.</p>
    <p>"Ticket, please," said the owl.</p>
    <p>"I don't have a ticket," said Pip. "I just want to see where the train goes."</p>
    <p>The owl smiled. "Then you're in luck. This is the Dream Train. It goes wherever you imagine."</p>
</div>

<div class="page">
    <p>Pip sat by the window. He closed his eyes and imagined.</p>
    <p>First, the train went to Cheese Mountain!</p>
    <p>Giant wheels of cheese rolled down the slopes.</p>
    <p>Pip laughed and nibbled a tiny piece.</p>
</div>

<div class="page">
    <p>Next, the train went to Balloon City!</p>
    <p>Houses floated in the sky, held up by colorful balloons.</p>
    <p>Pip waved at the cloud people.</p>
</div>

<div class="page">
    <p>Then, the train went to Blanket Beach!</p>
    <p>The sand was made of the softest blankets.</p>
    <p>Pip lay down and looked at the stars.</p>
</div>

<div class="page">
    <p>"Last stop," said the owl conductor.</p>
    <p>Pip looked out the window. He was home!</p>
    <p>His tiny house sat by the tracks, just like always.</p>
    <p>The light in the window glowed warm and yellow.</p>
</div>

<div class="page">
    <p>"How did you know?" asked Pip.</p>
    <p>"The Dream Train always knows when you're ready to come home," said the owl.</p>
    <p>"The best adventures end in your own bed."</p>
</div>

<div class="page">
    <p>Pip hopped off the train.</p>
    <p>He walked inside.</p>
    <p>He hung up his red scarf.</p>
</div>

<div class="page">
    <img src="pip-13-sleeping.png" alt="Pip sleeping">
    <p>He climbed into his cozy bed and pulled up the covers.</p>
    <p>Outside, he heard the train.</p>
    <p>WHOOOOSH! CLICKETY-CLACK!</p>
    <p>Pip smiled. He knew where it was going.</p>
</div>

<div class="page">
    <p>Wherever someone was dreaming.</p>
    <p class="the-end">THE END</p>
