## 2. Reddit Promotion

### Target Subreddits

| Subreddit | Members | Rules | Approach |
|-----------|---------|-------|----------|
| r/Parenting | 5.1M | No self-promo, but helpful links OK | Answer questions, mention site naturally |
| r/Mommit | 800K | Supportive community | Share as resource, not promotion |
| r/daddit | 1.1M | Dad-focused | Same approach |
| r/toddlers | 200K | Toddler-specific | Highly relevant audience |
| r/preschoolers | 50K | Ages 3-5 | Perfect fit |
| r/NewParents | 150K | First-time parents | Need bedtime help |
| r/sleeptrain | 100K | Sleep-focused | VERY relevant |
| r/beyondthebump | 300K | Post-newborn | Good for older babies/toddlers |

### Strategy: Don't Be Spammy
Reddit HATES self-promotion. The approach:

1. **Find relevant threads** - Search "bedtime stories" in parenting subs
2. **Give genuine advice first** - Actually help, don't just drop links
3. **Mention site naturally** - "We use snoozystories.com, it's free and the stories are designed to be calming"
4. **One post per sub** - Space it out over weeks

### Draft Reddit Comment (for when someone asks about bedtime)
```
We struggled with bedtime until we made it super consistent - bath, pajamas, two stories, lights out. 

For stories, we've been using snoozystories.com lately - free illustrated stories that are specifically designed to be calming (no exciting endings, no cliffhangers). The "Nutmeg's Cozy Night" one about a squirrel making a soft bed has become my daughter's favorite.

The key is keeping your voice really slow and quiet, especially toward the end. Good luck!
```

### Draft Reddit Post (for sharing)
**Title:** Free bedtime stories site we've been loving

```
Hey everyone! Wanted to share a free resource we discovered for bedtime.

snoozystories.com has a bunch of illustrated bedtime stories that are actually designed to be calming - no scary parts, no cliffhangers, they all end with the characters going to sleep. 

My 3yo loves the animal stories and asks for the same squirrel one every night (you know how it is 😅). The illustrations are really pretty too.

Just thought I'd share since we struggled with bedtime for so long and this has become part of our routine. Totally free, no sign-ups required.
```

**Best subs for this post:** r/toddlers, r/Mommit (avoid r/Parenting - stricter rules)

4. Engage with other posts genuinely

### Draft Facebook Post
```
🌙 Found a free bedtime stories site and had to share!

snoozystories.com has illustrated stories specifically designed to help kids wind down - no scary parts, no exciting cliffhangers, they all end peacefully.

My 4yo's new favorite is one about a squirrel collecting soft things for her bed. She asks for it EVERY night 😂

Totally free, no accounts needed. Just wanted to pass it along for anyone in the bedtime struggle!

✨ What bedtime stories are your kids obsessed with right now?

## 4. Pinterest Automation

### Option A: Tailwind (Recommended)
- $15/month for Pinterest scheduling
- Smart scheduling (posts at optimal times)
- Loops content automatically
- Can schedule weeks in advance

**Setup:**
1. You create Tailwind account: tailwindapp.com
2. Connect your Pinterest Business account
3. I provide pin designs + descriptions
4. You (or I via browser control) schedule them

### Option B: Pinterest Native Scheduler
- Free but manual
- Can schedule up to 2 weeks out
- You'd need to manually add pins weekly

### Option C: Later
- Free tier: 10 posts/month
- Paid tier: ~$18/month for more

### Pinterest Content Calendar
I already created the CSV with 26 pins. To automate:

**Daily Pin Schedule:**
- 8 AM: Story pin
- 12 PM: Quote/tip pin  
- 4 PM: Blog post pin (once we have blog)

**Pins Needed:**
- Story cover images (have 26)
- Quote graphics (I can create)
- Blog post graphics (I can create)
- "Bedtime tips" infographics (I can create)

### Pinterest SEO
Every pin needs:
- Keyword-rich title
- Keyword-rich description
- Relevant hashtags (5-10)
- Link to site

Example:
```
Title: 5 Minute Bedtime Story for Toddlers | Free Illustrated Story
Description: Looking for quick bedtime stories? This calming 5-minute tale is perfect for toddlers ages 2-4. Free to read, beautifully illustrated, designed to help little ones drift off to sleep. #bedtimestories #toddlermom #kidsstories #sleeptraining #freestories
```
