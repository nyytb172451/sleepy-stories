        "The bus drove through the night. Out the windows, Sam saw amazing things.\n\nA forest made of pillows.\nA river made of warm milk.\nMountains made of stuffed animals.\n\nEach child got off at a different stop—their own perfect dream.\n\n\"What will my dream be?\" Sam wondered.",
        "\"Last stop,\" called the driver.\n\nSam looked out the window. He saw his own house. His own room. His own bed, glowing warmly.\n\n\"But I wanted to go somewhere magical!\" said Sam.\n\n\"You already are,\" said the driver. \"The most magical place is the place where you feel safe and loved.\"\n\nSam climbed into bed. And he dreamed of flying, and laughing, and everything wonderful.\n\nAll without leaving home.\n\nTHE END"

        "\"I'm always here,\" said the shadow. Its voice was soft, like silk.\n\n\"Even in the dark?\" asked Mia.\n\n\"Especially in the dark,\" said the shadow. \"That's when you need me most. I'm the part of you that's brave when you don't feel brave. I'm the part that stays when everything else seems scary.\"\n\nMia had never thought about her shadow that way.",
        "\"Can you protect me from monsters?\" Mia asked.\n\nThe shadow smiled. \"There are no monsters. But if there were? I would grow very, very big.\" The shadow stretched across the whole wall, tall and strong.\n\nMia laughed. It felt good to laugh in the dark.",
        "From then on, Mia wasn't afraid of the dark.\n\nShe knew her shadow was there, stretched out beside her or tucked small beneath her pillow.\n\nSome nights she would whisper, \"Goodnight, shadow.\"\n\nAnd her shadow would wave.\n\nYou are never really alone. Even your shadow loves you.\n\nTHE END"
